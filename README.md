# MovieWorldProject
This was the final project for my Software Design 370 class. This website allows the user to create a website, get a confirmation email, see all the new movies coming out, add movies to a watchlist, and view trailers for all the new movies. This was a group project that lasted the whole semester. The website is mainly PHP and CSS. We used phpMyAdmin to manage the database. We used TMDB API to get all the up to date movie information.
